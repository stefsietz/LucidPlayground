# LucidPlayground

Lucid Playground is an interactive feature visualization interface, providing some of [Lucid's](https://github.com/tensorflow/lucid) functionality in the browser.
It uses the [LucidJS](https://github.com/stefsietz/LucidJS) library, which is based on[Tensorflow JS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js).
Obviously the name and the format are strongly inspired by [Tensorflow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org).

Be sure to read [Feature Visualization](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/) and the other related [Distill](https://distill.pub) articles to get some more information about the underlying concepts.
