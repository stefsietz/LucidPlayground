# LucidJS

This is a partial JavaScript/[Tensorflow JS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) port of [Lucid](https://github.com/tensorflow/lucid). It enables interactive feature visualization of CNN's in the browser.
This port tries to follow the original library as closely as possible, but deviates as necessary from differences between underlying languages / libraries.
